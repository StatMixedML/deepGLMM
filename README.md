## Introduction
DeepGLMM is a flexible model that use Deep Feedforward Neuron Network as the basis function for Generalized Linear Mixed Model. DeepGLMM is designed to work with panel data. <br/>

### How to use deepGLMM - MATLAB Version
To use the Toolbox, add the folder called "deepGLM" (with Subfolders) to the MATLAB path.

The toolbox contains the following folders:

- Data: some datasets used in the examples.
- Examples: examples of all the functions included in the toolbox.
- Documents: documentations for the functions in deepGLM toolbox
- deepGLM: all the functions of the toolbox all here. This is the folder you must add to the MATLAB path.
